[![Coverage](https://sonarcloud.io/api/project_badges/measure?project=LiveRamp_typed-mutations&metric=coverage&token=037d2e2776461459f204d7848fda9b02ab5dd68b)](https://sonarcloud.io/dashboard?id=LiveRamp_typed-mutations)

A lot of programming is merely translation between different structures. So, let's make that as painless as possible. Typed Mutations provides a simple syntax that lets you focus on behavior, rather than wrangling types.

It exposes two concepts, `KeyValues` (for objects), and `Collections` for arrays.

For examples of usage, check out the [tests](test)
